# ikarugo

A project I started to learn the basics of Pygame and game design.

Developed in Pygame, 'Ikarugo' is a clone of the classic vertical shooter 'Ikaruga'.

Requires Pygame for Python 3.x.

The player controls a square-shaped fighter plane. The game uses a mechanic that is similar to the one found in 'Ikaruga', whereby the player is able to toggle the color of the ship to absorb enemy projectiles of the same color. So if the ship is currently blue, it will absorb blue projectiles and take damage from red projectiles, and vice versa. Skillful use of color toggling will allow the player to survive chaotic dogfights with ease!
